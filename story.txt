Once upon a time, in a land far, far away...
<<<<<<< HEAD
A hungry fox found an egg and thought, “A chick will be a bigger meal.”
But when it hatched, he saw a tiny, fluffy chick staring up at him.
=======
Instead of eating it, he taught the chick to peck and hide.
Days passed, and his hunger faded—he had found a family.
